# Robomasters-Midterm

Prakhar Robomasters midterm 2

Prompt 1 
I have 1 py file cvprompt1.py which contains a colordetect class which provides with that if the frames contain blue > red . HSV sliders were used. The area is calculated and if blue is more than its a blue armour plate.The capture class is for video and frame processing. The video source can be a live video or a recording. 	

Prompt2 
Angle offsets are needed for proper aim. The getCoordinates function gets the coordinates of the frame and returns 4 coordinates + the median. Later it prints the coordinates and the offset values.

Prompt3
I used google slides to create systemd. The service file loads up on the virtual environment and late is copied to /end/system/systemd. I created the service file but, my system said my file did not exist anywhere in the system
